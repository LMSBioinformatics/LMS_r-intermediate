# Overview of this section

- Introducing piping
- **filter** verb
- **arrange** verb

```{r echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
library(stringr)
library(tidyr)
patients <- tbl_df(read.delim("patient-data.txt"))
```


We've ended up with a long chain of steps to perform on our data. It is quite common to nest commands in R into a single line;

```{r}
patients <- tbl_df(read.delim("patient-data.txt"))
```

we read as 

> apply the `tbl_df` to the result of reading the file `patient-data.txt`

Could also do the same for our `mutate` statements, although this would quickly become convoluted..

> remove the cm characters from the Height variable of the data frame created by trimming white space from the sex variable from the patients data frame

```{r}
patients_clean <- mutate(mutate(patients, Sex = factor(str_trim(Sex))),
                         Height = str_replace_all(patients$Height,pattern="cm",""))
```

We always have to work out what the first statement was, and work forwards from that.

- the arguments to a function are far-away from the function call

Alternatively, we could write each command as a separate line

```{r}
patients_clean<- mutate(patients, Sex = factor(str_trim(Sex)))
patients_clean <- mutate(patients_clean, Height= str_replace_all(patients_clean$Height,pattern = "cm",""))
```


- prone to error if we copy-and paste
- notice how the output of one line is the input to the following line


## Introducing piping

The output of one operations gets used as the input of the next

In computing, this is referring to as *piping* 

- unix commands use the `|` symbol

## magrittr

![not-a-pipe](images/pipe.jpeg)

![also-not-a-pipe](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b9/MagrittePipe.jpg)

- the `magrittr` library implements this in R

## Simple example

> read the file `patient-data.txt` ***and then*** use the `tbl_df` function

  - Use the special function ` %>% ` at the end of the line
  - Shortcut in RStudio: CTRL + SHIFT + M, CMD + SHIFT + M (Mac)
  
```{r eval=FALSE}
read.delim("patient-data.txt") %>% 
  tbl_df
```

The `read.delim` function produces a *data frame* as an output, and the `tbl_df` function only has one argument (a data frame). All the `dplyr` verbs that we will discuss today can be pipelined with ` %>% ` as they take a data frame as input, and produce a data frame as output.

Note that we need an assignment if we want to save the result

```{r}
patients <- read.delim("patient-data.txt") %>% 
  tbl_df
```


We can re-write our data cleaning steps from the previous section with;

```{r}
patients_clean <- read.delim("patient-data.txt") %>% 
  tbl_df %>% 
  mutate(Sex = factor(str_trim(Sex))) %>% 
  mutate(Height= as.numeric(str_replace_all(Height,pattern = "cm","")))

patients_clean
```

> read the file `patient-data.txt` ***and then*** use the `tbl_df` function ***and then*** trim the whitespace from the Sex variable ***and then*** replace cm with blank characters in the Height variable

Note that we didn't need to specify `patients_clean` as an argument to the `mutate` function

- it as assumed that the output of one line acts as the first argument to the next line
- we don't need to create temporary variables

## Exercise: [Rmarkdown Template](workflow-exercise.Rmd)

******

Take the steps used to clean the patients dataset and calculate BMI (see template for the code)

- Re-write in the piping framework
- Add a step to print just the ID, Name, Date of Birth, Smokes and Overweight columns

******

```{r echo=FALSE}
mutate(patients_clean, Weight = as.numeric(str_replace_all(patients_clean$Weight,"kg",""))) %>% 
  mutate(BMI = (Weight/(Height/100)^2), Overweight = BMI > 25) %>% 
  mutate(Smokes = str_replace_all(Smokes, "Yes", TRUE)) %>% 
  select(ID, Name, Birth,BMI,Smokes,Overweight)

```

Now having displayed the relevant information for our patients, we want to extract rows of interest from the data frame.


## Selecting rows: The `filter` verb

![filter](images/filter.png)

The **`filter`** verb is used to select rows from the data frame. The criteria we use to select can use the comparisons `==`, `>`, `<`, `!=`

e.g. select all the males

```{r}
filter(patients_clean, Sex == "Male") 
```

In base R, we would do

```{r eval=FALSE}
patients_clean[patients_clean$Sex == "Male",]
```

Again, to non R-users, this is less intuitive. However, the result is the same.

```{r echo=FALSE}
head(patients_clean[patients_clean$Sex == "Male",])
```

The `%in%` function can check for matches in a pre-defined vector

```{r}
filter(patients_clean, Pet %in% c("CAT", "Cat"))
```


Combining conditions in `filter` can be achieved adding `,` or using the Boolean operators `|`, `&`

```{r}
filter(patients_clean, Sex == "Male", Died)
```

The code in base R is a lot more verbose

```{r eval=FALSE}
patients[patients_clean$Sex == "Male" & patients_clean$Died,]
```

Either Females, or Grade greater than 1

```{r}
filter(patients_clean, Sex == "Female" | Grade_Level > 1)
```



## Exercise
******

  - Select the Smokers with Age over 30
  - Select the patients that are still alive
  - Select the patients who do NOT own dogs
  - Select the patients from New York or New Jersey

Feel free to experiment with different ways to do these

******

We now have all the tools in place in order to retrieve the overweight smokers from our dataset. An additional step might be to write the filtered data frame out to a file. Recall that functions `write.table`, `write.csv` are used to write a data frame to a tab-delimited or csv file. Because these functions accept a data frame as their first argument, they fit easily into the pipeline framework as the last step.


## Exercise: workflow-exercise.Rmd

******

Modify the workflow to 

- select the candidates (overweight smokers)
- make sure the candidates are still alive
- write the result to a csv file

******


## Ordering rows: The `arrange` verb

![arrange](images/arrange.png)

A related verb, that works on the rows of the table, is called **`arrange`**. You may have seen that we can use `order` in base R to re-order tables. Again, `arrange` is more intuitive.

Lets say we want to sort our patients by height;

```{r}
arrange(patients_clean, Height)
```

Can specify descending order using `desc`

```{r}
arrange(patients_clean, desc(Height))
```

Can use multiple variables in the sorting

e.g. `Grade_Level` and then `Count`

```{r}
arrange(patients_clean, Grade_Level, Count)
```

A really convenient function is `top_n`

```{r}
top_n(patients_clean,10,Height)
top_n(patients_clean,10,Weight)
```

With the workflow we have developed in the previous exercises, we can add extra steps to arrange and then select the candidates with the highest BMI prior to writing to a file.

```{r}
read.delim("patient-data.txt") %>% 
  tbl_df %>% 
  mutate(Sex = factor(str_trim(Sex))) %>% 
  mutate(Height= as.numeric(str_replace_all(Height,pattern = "cm",""))) %>% 
  mutate(Weight = as.numeric(str_replace_all(Weight,"kg",""))) %>% 
  mutate(BMI = (Weight/(Height/100)^2), Overweight = BMI > 25) %>% 
  mutate(Smokes = str_replace_all(Smokes, "Yes", TRUE)) %>% 
  mutate(Smokes = as.logical(str_replace_all(Smokes, "No", FALSE))) %>% 
  select(ID, Name, Birth,BMI,Smokes,Overweight,Died) %>% 
  filter(Smokes & Overweight & !Died) %>% 
  arrange(desc(BMI)) %>% 
  top_n(10, BMI)
  write.csv("candidates.csv")
```



## Re-usable pipelines

Imagine we have a second dataset that we want to process; `cohort-data.txt`. 

This time we have a million patients, and shouldn't really be dealing with these data in Excel. However, once we have defined a pipeline on our smaller dataset, we can see how it scales to the new data


```{r eval=FALSE}
 read.delim("cohort-data.txt") %>% 
  tbl_df %>% 
  mutate(Sex = factor(str_trim(Sex))) %>% 
  mutate(Weight = as.numeric(str_replace_all(Weight,"kg",""))) %>% 
  mutate(Height= as.numeric(str_replace_all(Height,pattern = "cm",""))) %>% 
  mutate(BMI = (Weight/(Height/100)^2), Overweight = BMI > 25) %>% 
  mutate(Smokes = as.logical(str_replace_all(Smokes, "Yes", TRUE))) %>% 
  mutate(Smokes = as.logical(str_replace_all(Smokes, "No", FALSE))) %>%
  filter(Smokes & Overweight) %>% 
  select(ID, Name, Birth, BMI, Smokes,Overweight)  %>% 
  arrange(desc(BMI)) %>% 
  top_n(10, BMI) %>% 
  write.table("study-candidates.csv")
```

As the file is quite large, we might want to switch to `readr` for smarter and faster reading

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(readr)
 read_tsv("cohort-data.txt") %>% 
  tbl_df %>% 
  mutate(Sex = factor(str_trim(Sex))) %>% 
  mutate(Weight = as.numeric(str_replace_all(Weight,"kg",""))) %>% 
  mutate(Height= as.numeric(str_replace_all(Height,pattern = "cm",""))) %>% 
  mutate(BMI = (Weight/(Height/100)^2), Overweight = BMI > 25) %>% 
  mutate(Smokes = str_replace_all(Smokes, "Yes", TRUE)) %>% 
  mutate(Smokes = as.logical(str_replace_all(Smokes, "No", FALSE))) %>%
  filter(Smokes & Overweight) %>% 
  select(ID, Name, Birth, BMI, Smokes,Overweight)  %>% 
  arrange(desc(BMI)) %>% 
  top_n(10, BMI) %>% 
  write.table("study-candidates.csv")
```

## Summary

In the past two sections we have introduced the concept of pipeline and various verbs in dplyr that will help us to manipulate our data

- select; for choosing columns
- mutate; for adding new columns
- filter; for selecting rows
- arrange; for ordering rows

We can use these in any order we like to create a workflow. When faced with a dataset, we should asked ourselves what steps we want to perform.

- The piping facility in R should allow us to express the workflow in a way that is intuitive and easy-to-ready
